        <p>Eden Hazard, was a player to behold. </p>
       <p>Always bringing joy to his Fans and causing menace to defenders and opponents. </p> 
       <p>Who wants to be a defender up against hazard?</p>
        <p> The master dribbler!</p>
        <p> He won the Premier League and many other trophies and Even was so generous that he came of the bench
        and gave leicester city the league.</p>
        <p> I remember the match against Arsenal, you made coquelin to stumble.</p>
        <p> Zableta of Man City was always either receiving a yellow card or causing a penalty or even both.</p>
        <p>Chelsea fc has not had a playmaker since you left.</p>
        <p>Now you have retired from football, we will not get to watch your moves again in real time.</p>
        <p>Thank you for the beautiful memories you have given to football.</p>
        <p>You will greatly be missed, Enjoy your retirement.</p>
